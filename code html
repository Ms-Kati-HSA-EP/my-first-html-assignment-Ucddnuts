 <h1>The Stains of Time lyrics</h1>
    <p>Wash away the anger...<p>
    </p>Here I stand beneath the warm and soothing rain.
The droplets falling gently down on the terrain.
Wash away the sorrow all the stains of time.
But there’s no memory it’s only dry inside.</p>
    <p>In the mud and sinking deeper.
Into a peaceful life</p>
    <p>And it will come like a flood of pain.
Pouring down on me!
And it will not let up
Until the end is here.</p>
    <p>And it will come through the darkest day.
In my final hour!
And it will never rest until the clouds are clear.
Until it finds my dreams have dissapeared.
